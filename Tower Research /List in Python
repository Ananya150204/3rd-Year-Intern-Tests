def my_func(x):
    x[0] = 200
    x = [200]

lst = [1, 2, 3]
my_func(lst)
print(lst)

Output : [200, 2, 3]

Reason : The function my_func takes a list x as an argument.
Inside the function, x[0] = 200 modifies the first element of the list x to be 200.
Then, x = [200] assigns a new list [200] to the local variable x, but this does not affect the original list lst outside the function.
When you print lst, you see that the first element has been changed to 200, but the rest of the list remains the same.
