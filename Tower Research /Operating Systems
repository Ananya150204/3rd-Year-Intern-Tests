The statement "If the size of a page increases, then the working set decreases" is partially correct:
1. The number of pages in the working set might decrease.
2. The total memory required by the working set might not decrease proportionally and could be affected by fragmentation and data locality.

Larger page sizes mean more data is brought into memory with each page fault, reducing the likelihood of subsequent page faults if the process accesses nearby data.
Fewer pages overall can reduce the frequency of page faults.

Round Robin scheduling can resemble First Come First Served scheduling when the ratio of job time to the number of jobs
decreases. This is because, in such cases, jobs are short and frequent, making the context switching overhead minimal 
compared to the total time taken for each job. Therefore, RR may effectively process jobs in the order they arrive, 
similar to FCFS, provided the time quantum is large enough relative to the job times.
